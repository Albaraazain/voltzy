# Job Scheduling and Management Flow Design

## Overview
This document outlines the proposed solution for handling complex job scheduling scenarios between homeowners and professionals, focusing on user experience and system flexibility.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Job Creation Types
1. **Public Job Posting** (Current Implementation)
   - Homeowner creates a job visible to all professionals
   - Any professional can accept/decline
   - Simple but lacks personalization

2. **Direct Request** (New Feature)
   - Homeowner selects a specific professional
   - Based on previous experience or recommendations
   - More personalized approach
   - Requires professional profile browsing feature

3. **Schedule-Based Booking** (New Feature)
   - Professional publishes available time slots
   - Homeowners can book specific slots
   - More structured approach
   - Requires calendar management

### 2. Job States

    [*] --> DRAFT: Homeowner creates
    DRAFT --> REQUESTED: Sent to professional
    REQUESTED --> ACCEPTED: Professional accepts
    REQUESTED --> DECLINED: Professional declines
    ACCEPTED --> IN_PROGRESS: Work starts
    ACCEPTED --> RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED: Either party requests
    RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED --> RESCHEDULED: New time agreed
    RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED --> CANCELLED: Cannot agree
    RESCHEDULED --> IN_PROGRESS: Work starts
    IN_PROGRESS --> COMPLETED: Work finished
    DECLINED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]
    COMPLETED --> [*]
```

#### State Definitions:
- **DRAFT**: Initial job creation by homeowner
- **REQUESTED**: Sent to specific professional
- **ACCEPTED**: Professional has agreed to job
- **DECLINED**: Professional cannot take job
- **RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED**: Change in schedule needed
- **RESCHEDULED**: New schedule agreed upon
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Work has started
- **COMPLETED**: Work finished
- **CANCELLED**: Job terminated before completion

### 3. User Experience Flows

#### A. Homeowner Flow

     - Select available time slot
   - Fill job details
     - Description
     - Photos
     - Preferred dates/times
     - Budget range

2. **Managing a Job**
   - View job status

   - Respond to reschedule requests
   - Cancel if needed
   - Rate after completion

#### B. Professional Flow

1. **Profile Management**

   - Mark emergency slots
   - Buffer time between jobs

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Automated suggestions for reschedule
   - Priority handling
   - Emergency override options

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New tables needed:

-- Professional availability
CREATE TABLE professional_availability (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    professional_id UUID,
    date DATE,
    start_time TIME,
    end_time TIME,
    status VARCHAR(20), -- AVAILABLE, BOOKED, BLOCKED
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Schedule changes
CREATE TABLE schedule_changes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id UUID,
    requested_by UUID,
    original_date DATE,
    original_time TIME,
    proposed_date DATE,
    proposed_time TIME,
    status VARCHAR(20), -- PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Direct requests
CREATE TABLE direct_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id UUID,
    homeowner_id UUID,
    professional_id UUID,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints

1. **Schedule Management**
```
GET /api/professional/{id}/availability
POST /api/professional/{id}/availability
PUT /api/professional/{id}/availability/{id}
DELETE /api/professional/{id}/availability/{id}
```

2. **Direct Requests**
```
POST /api/jobs/{id}/request/{professional_id}
GET /api/professional/{id}/requests
PUT /api/requests/{id}/respond
```

3. **Schedule Changes**
```
POST /api/jobs/{id}/reschedule
GET /api/jobs/{id}/schedule-changes
PUT /api/schedule-changes/{id}/respond
```

## User Interface Updates
